### Beyond the physical.

Like many people, I started doing Yoga as I felt attracted to the physical exercise. It didn't take long, however, to realise that Yoga was so much more than that. After the class **I felt every cell in body vibrating**, I was physically exhausted yet energetically charged as I never felt before. I sensed the infinite potential of the practise that goes beyond the physical.

### An eternal soul.

As I commited more and more to Yoga, I observed vast changes happening in my life. Not only my body became stronger and flexible, so did I - as a person, as a living being, as a loving being. The practise brought **peace, harmony and consciousness** into my life. The practise made me realise that I am not an individual being separate from the external world, but an eternal soul deeply rooted in everything that is. The practise gave me bliss.

### Sharing the bliss.

Benefiting from the Yoga practise in such a profound way, I felt the deep urge to share this wonderful experience with others. I sensed the potential not only for the individual but for mankind, by helping people to find back to their true selves and become their highest versions. To this day my motivation has not changed: **Inspiring minds, opening hearts, expanding consciousness - this is why I teach.**

## holistic

As my own dedicated journey has strongly influenced my approach to teaching, I emphasise the spiritual practise just as much as the physical practise. In my classes you will not only be working with your body, but also nurturing your soul as you go deep inside.

Loving both the physically demanding aspects of an instense dynamic Asana practise and the blessed effects of consciousness-expanding meditations, my classes follow a holistic approach to Yoga with strong influences of traditional teachings brought to modern life.

## Ashtanga Yoga 

After more than two years of intense Ashtanga Vinyasa practise, this powerful dynamic yoga style has become a fundamental part of my life. daily asana practise - does not stop on the mat: ashtanga

As a **certified Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga teacher**, I focus on teaching this traditional yoga style in a comprehensive manner putting all eight limbs into practise. I offer both **led classes of the full primary series** or variations of it and classes in **Mysore style**, as well as pranayama and meditation sessions.

## Hatha & Vinyasa Yoga

Furthermore I also offer **Hatha and Vinyasa Yoga sessions** which are suitable for all levels of experience and can be adopted individually.

Providing **safe guidance and profound knowledge** about the practise. With hands-on adjustments I help the student to find a deeper access to the asanas, the body postures of Yogic practise.

### All classes are available in English and German.

## Yoga workshops

In addition to Yoga classes I also offer workshops on specific purposes and themes. Following is a **selection of available workshops**:

## Led Meditation & Yoga Nidra

Every Yoga class ends with Savasana, the end relaxation where the whole body comes to rest after the physical practise. With my deep pleasant voice **I guide you into deep relaxation** helping you to find a quiet mind and a restorative set-up for your body.

Further I offer **extended meditation sessions** of up to one hour, both for general healing and specific purposes like anxiety or physical pain. 

I also guide **Yoga Nidra**, the term meaning 'yogic sleep' and describing a meditative state of consciousness between being awake and falling asleep. In this practise you will be able to find deep relaxation and restore both physical and emotional energy resources.
