When I started doing Yoga, I was looking for nothing more than physical exercise. It didn't take me long to realise the **infinite potential of the practise that goes beyond the physical**. The seed was planted.

As the sprout was growing, I observed vast changes happening in my life. Not only my body became stronger and flexible, so did I - as a person, as a living being. I found the practise bringing peace, harmony and consciousness into my life. **Yoga inspired me.**

Seeing the effect the practise had on myself, I felt the deep urge to spread the **indescribable joy and the infinite bliss Yoga brings**. I realised that by teaching Yoga I will be able to help people find back to their true selves and become the highest versions of themselves. My motivation was set. The plant was grown.

## Ashtanga, Vinyasa & Hatha Yoga

As a **certified Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga teacher**, I focus on teaching this powerful dynamic Yoga style. I offer both led classes guiding through the full primary series or variations of it and classes in Mysore style. 

Moreover, I also teach **Hatha and Vinyasa Yoga sessions** which are suitable for all levels of experience.

I am able to adopt my classes to the student's individual level, providing **safe guidance and profound knowledge** about the practise. With hands-on adjustments I help the student to find a deeper access to the asanas, the body postures of Yogic practise.

### All classes are available in English and German.

## Yoga workshops

In addition to Yoga classes I also offer workshops on specific purposes and themes. Following is a **selection of available workshops**:

+ arm balance poses for beginners and intermediate
+ backbends for men
+ fluent transitions in Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga
+ proper breathing for asana practise
+ Ashtanga Vinyasa: introduction to the primary series
+ and more...

## Led Meditation & Yoga Nidra

Every Yoga class ends with Savasana, the end relaxation where the whole body comes to rest after the physical practise. With my deep pleasant voice **I guide you into deep relaxation** helping you to find a quiet mind and a restorative set-up for your body.

Further I offer **extended meditation sessions** of up to one hour, both for general healing and specific purposes like anxiety or physical pain. 

I also guide **Yoga Nidra**, the term meaning 'yogic sleep' and describing a meditative state of consciousness between being awake and falling asleep. In this practise you will be able to find deep relaxation and restore both physical and emotional energy resources.

## Healing sound experience

I love to combine my two passions of Yoga and music with one another, providing unique sound bath meditation, collective bhajan singing and more. **For more information, have a look at my [music page]({{< relref "music.md" >}}).**
