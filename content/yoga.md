As my own dedicated journey has strongly influenced my approach to teaching, I emphasise the spiritual practise just as much as the physical practise. In my classes you will not only be **working with your body, but also nurturing your soul** as you go deep inside.

Loving both the physically demanding aspects of an instense dynamic Asana practise and the blessed effects of consciousness-expanding meditations, my classes follow a **holistic approach to Yoga** with strong influences of traditional teachings brought to modern life.

## Ashtanga Yoga 

With many years of intense Ashtanga Vinyasa practise, this powerful dynamic yoga style has become a fundamental part of my life. Putting all eight limbs (the meaning of "ashta anga") into practise, this does not stop once I leave the mat after the daily asana practise. Yoga truely has become my lifestyle.

As a **certified Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga teacher**, I focus on teaching this traditional yoga style in a comprehensive manner putting all eight limbs into practise. I offer both **led classes of the full primary series** or variations of it and classes in **Mysore style**, as well as pranayama and meditation classes. In individual classes and workshops you can go into detailed understanding of the Ashtanga practise depending on your personal needs.

In the last few years I have been teaching in different locations in Europa and Central America. Since 2020 I offer my courses mainly on the west coast of Mexico. For further information, contact me directly.

### All classes are available in English and German.

## Workshops & discourses

In addition to Yoga classes I offer workshops on specific purposes and themes. Following is a **selection of possible workshops**:

+ Play with gravity - arm balance poses for beginners and intermediate
+ Open yourself - backbends and emotions
+ Learn to fly - fluent transitions between asanas
+ The breath is the practise - breathing in asana
+ and more...

Moreover, I am happy to give discourses and shared discussions on different topics:

+ philosophy, including but not limited to Yogic philosophy
+ The eight limbs - how to put Ashtanga in to practise
+ the life as travelling yogi

## Led Meditation & Yoga Nidra

Every Yoga class ends with Savasana, the end relaxation where the whole body comes to rest after the physical practise. With my deep pleasant voice **I guide you into deep relaxation** helping you to find a quiet mind and a restorative set-up for your body.

Further I offer **extended meditation sessions** of up to one hour, both for general healing and specific purposes like anxiety or physical pain.  I guide **Yoga Nidra**, the term meaning 'yogic sleep' and describing a meditative state of consciousness between being awake and falling asleep. In this practise you will be able to find deep relaxation and restore both physical and emotional energy resources.

## Healing sound

I love to combine my two passions of Yoga and music with one another, providing unique sound bath meditation, collective bhajan singing and more. **For more information, have a look at my [music page]({{< relref "music.md" >}}).**
