My musical journey started more than 10 years ago when I picked up the guitar for the first time. Starting mainly with classical music in finger-picking style, I was about to go through many different musical stages - from covering pop songs to German rap to ambient acoustic improvisations. All of these are still part of my current musical expression, however, real depth has only come since I have found spiritual access to music. 

### devotion.

Yoga and the increased consciousness that comes with it have changed my way of living in all aspects, including making music. Being present allows to dive deeper into the moment, open yourself towards the sound in all of its richness, perceiving the miracle in it, the wonder, the divine. This journey has led me to a spiritual approach towards music, singin devotional and holy songs - not as a form making music, but as a way of meditating, honoring life itself.

## the santur

Despite having played quite a few instruments in my life, what really brought a vast change was the moment the santur came into my life. Its mystical, enchanting, sweet sound touched my soul as no other instrument ever had before. Straight away I knew this was the instrument I had always been looking for without even knowing it. 

### a special instrument.

Not only due to its unique sound, but also because of its Persian origin and its 72 strings, the santur is a very special instrument. It belongs to the category of the hammered dulcimers which are being used throughout the world, with quite some variations. However, in most countries these string instruments have become rare, but they still quite common both in India and Iran.

### unique by nature.

As it has been accessible to me from the beginning, the santur is the only instrument I never had to learn to play. I don't have to think about notes, theory or what I would like to create - instead I open myself fully towards the instrument and its sound and allow the spirit to flow freely. In this way everytime I play is completely unique. Every concert and every healing sound meditation is a musical expression of the exceptional present moment we share together.

### into different worlds.

There is no word that could describe my concerts better than "journey". When the santur and I flow together....
