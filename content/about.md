## Namast√©, my dear friend.

I am happy to welcome you to my website. Before I get more into detail about me and my personal life, I want to emphasise: This journey is about YOU. At best, I will be able to inspire you, guide you along your process or deepen your personal practise. However, in the end YOU are writing YOUR OWN LIFESTORY - at this very moment. Never underestimate your potential. You are infinite!

## Who am I

There is hardly any question that is so hard to answer than "Who am I?". I wonder: In which way would you, who has found his way to my website, want me to introduce myself? If you are interested in my person, the ephemeral form I have taken for this life, I might want to tell you things like: My name is Cale Alit and I grew up in Germany, started travelling right after school and never stopped doing so, moved into a van three years ago, love the nature, the freedom, playing music and cooking. 

### If I could.

Maybe, however, you would like to get straight to the source and get to know the Self beyong the body and the mind. If I could, I would skip the words and let our souls touch immediately - but this will have to wait until we meet in real-life. 

## My Yogic journey

### Beyond the physical.

Like many people, I started doing Yoga as I felt attracted to the physical exercise. It didn't take long, however, to realise that Yoga was so much more than that. After the class **I felt every cell in body vibrating**, I was physically exhausted yet energetically charged as I never felt before. I sensed the infinite potential of the practise that goes beyond the physical.

### An eternal soul.

As I commited more and more to Yoga, I observed vast changes happening in my life. Not only my body became stronger and flexible, so did I - as a person, as a living being, as a loving being. The practise brought **peace, harmony and consciousness** into my life. The practise made me realise that I am not an individual being separate from the external world, but an eternal soul deeply rooted in everything that is. The practise gave me bliss.

### Sharing the bliss.

Benefiting from the Yoga practise in such a profound way, I felt the deep urge to share this wonderful experience with others. I sensed the potential not only for the individual but for mankind, by helping people to find back to their true selves and become their highest versions. To this day my motivation has not changed: **Inspiring minds, opening hearts, expanding consciousness - this is why I teach.**
